2. Run the executable named "NumPi Arcade.exe"

### macOS
1. Navigate into the Windows folder

2. You will see an application named "macOS.app". This is what you will try to run later in step 4.

3. Open a terminal session and navigate to the folder where you downloaded it. Run this command to set the executable permissions:
chmod a+x Builds/macOS/macOS.app/Contents/MacOS/* 

4. Double click to try and open. Mac will give you a security error.

5. Navigate to System Preferences > Security and Privacy > General tab.
